//! Qt Quick and Kirigami (KDE Plasma) backend for mitsuami.
//!
//! - Windows are `Kirigami.ApplicationWindow`s with one page, whose title
//!   shows in Kirigami's toolbar. The page's content is a plain item that
//!   does no layout: children sit at the frames the core computed.
//! - Leaves are Qt Quick Controls in the `org.kde.desktop` style (Breeze on
//!   Plasma), created from QML and measured by their implicit sizes.
//! - Escape hatches: [`NativeRender`] for custom widgets, [`NativeView`] for
//!   any QML item, and a `QPainter` item for drawn custom widgets.
//! - Signals become [`UiEvent`](mitsuami_core::UiEvent)s.
//! - [`run`] drives the app: the UI ticks whenever Qt's event loop is about
//!   to sleep.
//! - Services: Qt's clipboard, `Kirigami.PromptDialog`, Qt Quick's file
//!   dialogs, and the app's menus in a Kirigami global drawer.
//!
//! The backend is built with the `qt` feature (which `mitsuami`'s `kde`
//! feature turns on); without it this crate is empty, so workspaces build
//! where Qt isn't installed. It links Qt 6.5 or newer, and needs Kirigami
//! and `qqc2-desktop-style` at run time.
