//! Fine-grained, single-threaded reactivity for mitsuami.
//!
//! The API follows Vue's Composition API, adapted to Rust:
//!
//! | Vue | mitsuami |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ref(x)` | [`signal`] (`ref` is a Rust keyword) |
//! | `computed(fn)` | [`computed`] |
//! | `watchEffect(fn)` | [`effect`] |
//! | `watch(src, cb)` | [`watch`] |
//! | `provide` / `inject` | [`provide`] / [`inject`] |
//! | `onUnmounted` / `onScopeDispose` | [`on_cleanup`] |
//!
//! All handles are `Copy` indexes into a thread-local arena. They belong to
//! the [`Owner`] that was current when they were created and stop working
//! once that owner is disposed.
//!
//! Effects run synchronously: immediately when created, then whenever a
//! dependency changes. Group several writes with [`batch`] so dependents run
//! once, after all of them.
